## Database Design

**Key Entities**

- **Users**: id, name, email, password_hash, role (guest/host)
- **Properties**: id, owner_id (FK), title, location, price_per_night
- **Bookings**: id, property_id (FK), user_id (FK), start_date, end_date
- **Reviews**: id, user_id (FK), property_id (FK), rating, comment
- **Payments**: id, booking_id (FK), amount, status, payment_method

**Relationships**

- Users may own many properties.
- Properties can have multiple bookings and reviews.
- Bookings link users and properties.
- Payments are tied to bookings.

---

## Feature Breakdown

- **User Management**: Registration, authentication, profiles, roles.
- **Property Management**: Host listings with images, pricing, and calendar.
- **Booking System**: Search, filter, book, with date and price validation.
- **Review System**: Guests leave post-stay feedback.
- **Payment Integration**: Secure transactions, payment tracking, status updates.
- **Admin Dashboard**: Oversight of users, listings, and financials.

---

## API Security

- **Authentication**: JWT-based identity verification.
- **Authorization**: Role-based permissions (e.g., only hosts can add listings).
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents abuse.
- **Input Validation**: Protects against injections and malformed requests.
- **HTTPS Enforcement**: Encrypts all data in transit.

Security is foundational—protecting user data, securing transactions, and ensuring reliability.

---

## CI/CD Pipeline

- Continuous integration & deployment using GitHub Actions and Docker.
- Feature branch workflow, code reviews, and meaningful commit messages.
- Automated rollback support for stability and agility.

---

## UI Component Patterns

  - Logo, search bar, user navigation, responsive menu
- **Property Card**
  - Image, price, location, rating, favorite button, responsive layout
- **Footer**
  - Site links, company info, social media, copyright

All components are built for reusability, accessibility, and visual consistency.

---

## Best Practices
